<h3>PART 1 - Analyze the website using the usability framework</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<div class="w3-container w3-margin">
<p>Upon using The Tower Archive (1922-2018), my search results for "presidential election" rendered the following inputs and outputs.</p>  
</div>
<table>
<table class="center">
	<tr>
		<th>Input</th>
		<th>Output</th>
		<th>Type</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Search "presidential election" in archives and special collections</td>
		<td>1,095 results</td>
		<td>Titles and contents</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Filter date range to 1952-1953</td>
		<td>10 results</td>
		<td>Years and contents</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Select first result, "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 1952"</td>
		<td>Opens a digital version of the document</td>
		<td>Content</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Search the document for the word "election"</td>
		<td>10 pages with results</td>
		<td>Text</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>My analysis of Nielsen's heuristics was based on search results for the topic "presidential election".</p>
<ol>
	<li>Visibility of the system - When the user applies specific filters, they can be easily eliminated by clicking the "(x)" to the right of the filter at the top of the search results. Also, you can press the button "back to results" to easily maneuver back to the results page instead of using the back button. This creates easy navigation and bread crumbing for the user.</li>
	<li>Match between the system and the real world - The collection filters next to the search bar include, all collections, archives and special collections, Oliviera Lima library, and research repository. It is not clear to the average researcher the difference or context around Oliver Lima Library and research repository. It would be helpful for the website to have a navigation explanation for these on an FAQ page.</li>
	<li>User control and freedom - Searches within documents and in the search bar take a while to load. Sometimes they never fully load and you need to refresh or hit the back button. There is also no cancel button which can leave you stuck for a few minutes. This can lead to a frustrated user who's impatience might result in using another site.</li>
	<li>Consistency and Standards - The search bars and key information is easy to find and meets industry standards. It was easy to navigate for the user.</li>
	<li>Error prevention - Top search results often didn't seem relevant to the search until you read the document. The words searched often weren't in the title or anywhere in the list of results. This made the search results confusing on relevancy until you searched within the documents themselves. It would be helpful for key words to be displayed with the search results.</li>
	<li>Recognition rather than recall - The search bar changes locations when moving from a general search to within a document search. Additionally, there is a large magnifying glass that restarts your search instead of searching within the results. It's purpose is unclear and confusing to the user.</li>
	<li>Flexibility and efficiency of use - After clicking on a search result, you can see the trail of how you got there and can go back to the beginning or back to other steps.</li>
	<li>Aesthetic and minimalist design - Sometimes a side tab pops up with similar search results that is distracting and not relevant. Overall the website is free from adds and confusing or distracting images.</li>
	<li>Help users - When searching for items in the text it will not notify the user if no results are found. This makes the user uncertain if the page just didn't load properly or if there are no results.</li>
	<li>Help and documentation - There is no help button, chat bot, or FAQ page. However, there is a thorough contact us page with multiple phone numbers and emails to reach out to.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Overall, the Tower is easy to navigate and has many helpful filter features. They are clearly invested in helping researchers find good materials based on the robust contact us page and the links to breadcrumbs. Where the Tower falls short is in loading times and identifying helpful resources. Sometimes a source will not load and a user has to refresh or reload the page multiple times. This was frustrating as a user and time consuming. Lastly, the search results were often based upon contents of a document and not the title or subject line. This meant that search results were not obviously applicable since there was no key word identifier. Please see below my examples of these successes and pitfalls.

<h5>Strength 1 - Contact Page</h5>

<h5>Strength 2 - Navigation and Breadcrumbs</h5>

<h5>Weakness 1 - Load Time</h5>

<h5>Weakness 2 - Unclear Search Results</h5>

</p>

<h3>PART 2 - Conduct a "mini-usability test"</h3>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p> Please see my questionnaire and observation form uploaded to the Brightspace.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>My results from the heuristic review and mini-usability test rendered similar results. My struggles with The Tower were also the main struggles for my volunteer and my successes were also their successes. The strengths and weaknesses were the same as outlined above and while I found a lot more insights with the analysis of the heuristic guidelines, my volunteer felt similarly based upon their answers to the agree/disagree table. The heuristic review really helped guide my critique of the system because it had me look at all aspects of the website. Whereas with the usability test, my volunteer was only given a goal of what to find and to see if they could be successful rather than analayze all parts of the website.</p> 
<p>Overall, The Tower could benefit from increasing loading times and utilizing key words in search results. This would make the website easier to navigate and more appealing to researchers. Additionally, having a chat bot or FAQ page would be helpful for people to look up simple answers instead of calling or emailing the contacts listed on the contact us page. Based upon both my findings and my volunteers findings, these would be extremely beneficial to the usability of The Tower as a research tool.</p>
